## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 450&deg;
2. If using frozen riced cauliflower, cook according to package directions.
If using fresh, put about half a head of cauliflower in food processor to rice
it and then steam for a few minutes.  Squeeze as much water out of cooked
cauliflower as possible.  It's helpful to use a clean kitchen towel or
cheesecloth if you have it.  
3. In large bowl, mix cauliflower, egg, mozzarella, Italian seasoning, garlic
powder, salt and pepper until thoroughly combined.
4. Line a circle pizza pan with parchment paper.  Press cauliflower mixture
onto pan and spread into large, thin circle.  (The mixture won't be the same
consistency as dough)
5. Cook in over for about 20-40 minutes, depending on how crispy you like your
crust.
6. While crust is cooking, cut bacon into small pieces and cook a little under
how done you like it. (it will cook fully in oven)
7. Cook sausage patty and let cool.  Then cut into small pieces.
8. Scramble your eggs in a bowl and then cook in about a tablespoon of leftover
bacon grease.
9. Take crust out of the oven and let cool for a couple minutes.  When cooled
enough to touch, spread cheese sauce mixture on top of crust to your liking.
Salt and pepper to taste.  Spread scrambled egg over cheese sauce, followed by
bacon and sausage.  Finally, top with grated cheese and put back in the oven.
Bake for about 5-15 more minutes, depending on how well you like it cooked.
10. Let cool, slice into pieces (I do 12) and Enjoy!

> * Preshredded cheese usually has starches added to it so I don't buy it.
I purchase cheese in blocks and add it to a food processor and pulse for a few
seconds. You could also just shred with a normal cheese grater. You can use any
cheese you would like for the pizza, I just kept it simple with cheddar and
mozzarella. Also, add or subtract any other toppings to your taste preference.
